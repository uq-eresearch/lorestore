lorestore
=========

The Open Annotation lorestore Web Application was developed at the UQ ITEE eResearch Lab: http://itee.uq.edu.au/~eresearch

About
-----

The webapp provides services for storing OAC annotations and ORE Resource Map bodies and targets.
We use the web app for our Open Annotation service at 
[http://openannotation.metadata.net/lorestore/](http://openannotation.metadata.net/lorestore/)

The source code for the lorestore webapp is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/uq-eresearch/lorestore/)


Packaging
----------

Apache Maven is used for dependency management and building the web app. 

The web app can be configured via  override.properties, substitution.properties and xml files in WEB-INF/
directly or by a local override file (see Deployment), or these files can be overridden within a Maven war overlay.

We use eclipse to import lorestore into the workspace as a Maven project (using eGit and m2eclipse). 
We build the war file via an eclipse Maven run configuration equivalent to the following command:
mvn clean package

To configure the eclipse run configuration, set basedir to `${workspace_loc:/lorestore}` and goals to `clean package`.

The resulting war file will be `lorestore/target/lorestore.war`


Deployment
----------

lorestore uses DIAS-B Emmet to manage authentication and authorisation. 
Emmet uses a MySQL database, which must be created with appropriate access permissions before deploying the war. 
Emmet creates required tables when run for the first time.

You will also need to create a directory to which the web app server has write access, for storing the lorestore Sesame RDF repository. 

The location of the data directory, Emmet database name and access details, default hostname and port etc are configured through properties in the substitution.properties file in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes`
To override these values after the war file has been built, create a file named 'local-lorestore-substitution.properties' containing the new values, and place it in the Tomcat lib directory.

Basic steps to deploy lorestore using default configuration on Unix-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac OSX):

1. Create a mysql database 'lorestore' accessed by user 'lorestore' using password 'lorestorepwd'

`mysql> create database lorestore;`
`mysql> grant all privileges on lorestore.* to 'lorestore'@'localhost' identified by 'lorestorepwd'; `

2. Create directory `/usr/share/lorestore` with appropriate file permissions

3. Deploy war file to Apache Tomcat running on localhost port 8080


User accounts
-------------
Default user accounts are configured in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/Emmet-userDetails-lorestore.xml`
These accounts will be created by Emmet on first run, and by default are ignored on subsequent deployments. 
Refer to the `newTables` property in the userDetails configuration file to modify this behaviour.
Use the User Management tools within the web app to create or configure user accounts.

Backup
------
Use `mysqldump` to backup Emmet user data.

Use lorestore's `oreadmin/export` page to export the RDF repository that stores OAC annotations and Resource Maps to file. 
The file format supported for export and import is Trig; resource maps and annotations are stored as Named Graphs.

History
-------
This web app is derivative of the [Aus-e-Lit webapp](https://github.com/auselit/webapp), by the same developers:
